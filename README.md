freeCodeCamp Basic Javascript learning path - Build a Role Playing Game

A simple text based game with minimal UI and styling.
Makes considerable use of arrays of objects that allows for examples of bracket and dot notation, push(), pop(), and shift().
Being driven by user choice, IF statements make up a large part of the functionality.

The initial commit is the basic feature functional version.
The update includes more dynamic combat outcomes through Math.random() including: random hit success, power, and chance of weapon damage.
It also includes a random number generator easter egg.
